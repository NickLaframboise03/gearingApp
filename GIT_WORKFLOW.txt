Git workflow for vehicle-efficiency-dash (server)

=================================================


Repository location on this server

----------------------------------

Project directory:

    ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash


Make sure you are in that folder before running any git commands:


    cd ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash

    git status



1) Pull the latest changes from GitHub (no local edits)

-------------------------------------------------------

Use this when you have NOT modified anything locally (or you don’t care about untracked files).


Commands:


    cd ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash


    # Check that there are no local changes

    git status


    # Pull the latest version of "main" from GitHub

    git pull --rebase origin main


If there are no local changes, this will just update the folder to match GitHub.



2) Pull the latest changes when you HAVE local edits

----------------------------------------------------

Use this when you have modified files on the server and you want to keep those changes AND also bring in any new commits from GitHub.


Step A – commit your local changes:


    cd ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash


    # See what changed

    git status


    # Stage all changes (new/modified/deleted files)

    git add .


    # Commit them with a short message

    git commit -m "Describe what changed on server (date/feature)"


Step B – pull from GitHub with rebase:


    git pull --rebase origin main


What this does:

- Downloads new commits from GitHub

- Replays your local commit(s) on top of them


If there are merge conflicts, Git will tell you which files are affected.

Resolve conflicts in those files, then:


    git add <file_you_fixed>

    git rebase --continue


Repeat until the rebase completes. You can confirm with:


    git status


It should say something like:

    "On branch main

     Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by X commits."



3) Push your current server version back to GitHub

--------------------------------------------------

After committing changes (and after any rebase is complete), push to GitHub:


    cd ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash


    # Optional: confirm what will be pushed

    git status


    # Push local main -> origin/main on GitHub

    git push origin main


You may be prompted for GitHub credentials:

- Username: your GitHub username

- Password/token: personal access token (if passwords are not accepted)



4) Typical workflow when updating the app on the server

-------------------------------------------------------

1) Go to project folder:


       cd ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash


2) Get the latest from GitHub:


       git pull --rebase origin main


3) Make your code changes (edit app.py, compute.py, etc.) and test.


4) Save vehicle_profiles.json and any other updates you want to keep.


5) Stage and commit:


       git add .

       git commit -m "Short description of change"


6) Push back to GitHub:


       git push origin main



5) Quick command summary

------------------------

From inside:

    ~/nick/vehicle-efficiency-dash/new-vehicle-efficiency-dash


Check status:

    git status


Pull latest (no local changes or after commit):

    git pull --rebase origin main


Stage everything:

    git add .


Commit:

    git commit -m "message"


Push to GitHub:

    git push origin main


Abort a broken rebase (if things get messy):

    git rebase --abort



Notes

-----

- Always run `git status` before `git pull` or `git push` to see the current state.

- Commit your changes BEFORE pulling with `--rebase` to avoid losing work.

- vehicle_profiles.json is tracked, so any updates to profiles on this server can be committed and pushed like any other file.
